I have three threads so far.
The base station one that makes 500 tourists then shuts down. These tourists are tracked by the tourist_counter object.
What I need to do is implement the gondola and top threads.
The gondola thread needs to try acquire permits for both spaces on the gondola and the 50 spaces at the top of the mountain.
It will ferry people from the bottom to the top, then the top to the bottom.
Ive got the top station to move people from the top to the getting down queue
